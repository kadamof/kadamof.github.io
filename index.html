    <h1>Resume</h1>
    <p>of Kim Adamof</p>
    <div id="name">
      <p><strong>My past life includes</strong> administrative assistant, legal assistant,sales, marketing, realtor, broker/owner of a real estate company, and more recently I’ve turned all of my skills into Social Media and Internet Marketing strategies.</p>

<p><strong>January 2011 I started Raleigh Inbound Marketing.</strong> I believe in “inbound marketing,” which is putting your business in front of people already looking for your service or product and giving them a reason to raise their hand.</p>

<p><strong>My job is to help you create a purpose for each platform’s use, layout a strategy for each platform, and implement jobs, projects and tasks for lead generation. I say that I use Inbound Marketing and Social Media Strategies to fix a business’s website and Facebook page for more leads.</p>

<p><strong>I like to be creative,</strong> am a problem-solver and a project manager. Marketing is my passion.</p>
