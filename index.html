      <h3>Kim Adamof, Director of Marketing and Social Media</h3>
        <p><span style="color: #101010;"><strong>In 2006, I set up my own real estate brokerage called Progressive Real Estate.</strong></span> During this time, I recruited agents and had 2 personal assistants. To keep everyone working I had to become proficient at lead generation. My website was not a typical real estate website. By using a CMS platform that I could manage myself, as well as watching my analytics reports, I built content around what buyers and sellers were already searching for. Strategically placing my company online helped me to generate enormous amounts of leads, which were put into a sales funnel and over $6 million worth of business was produced annually.</p>

        <p><span style="color: #101010;"><strong>While working on my Progressive Real Estate website,</strong></span> I became a Certified Internet Marketing Specialist through Hubspot. Learning SEO and content strategies is what ultimately helped me sustain my real estate business.</p>

        <p><span style="color: #101010;"><strong>Twitter started several years ago</strong></span> and I jumped on-board and started tweeting in 2008. My following grew. When I would go to events and talk to business owners, they were just hearing about Twitter and social media but unsure how to use it. I was already practicing.</p>

        <p><span style="color: #101010;"><strong>January 2011 I started </strong></span>Raleigh Inbound Marketing. I believe in “inbound marketing,” which is putting your business in front of people already looking for your service or product and giving them a reason to raise their hand.</p>

        <p><span style="color: #101010;"><strong>Since 2006,</strong></span> I've gained a lot of skills, knowledge, and experience in SEO, marketing, internet marketing, content writing, and most importantly social media.</p>

        <p>My job is to help you create a purpose for each platforms use, layout a strategy for each platform, and implement jobs, projects and tasks for lead generation. <span style="color: #101010;"><strong>I say that I use Inbound Marketing and Social Media Strategies to fix a business's website and Facebook page for more leads.</strong></span></p>

<span style="color: #101010;"><strong>My unique abilities include being creative, an organizer,</strong></span> caring &amp; enthusiastic to see you succeed. I am a problem-solver and a project manager. Marketing is my passion.</p>
